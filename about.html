        an <a> tag, linking to a related page (e.g. a wikipedia page of your favorite animal).
        If you have multiple favorites in a category, try a nested list inside of an li!

    <h3>One of my favorite quotes</h3>
    <!--
        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure
